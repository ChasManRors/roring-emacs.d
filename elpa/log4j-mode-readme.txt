;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a major mode for viewing log files, including syntax
;; highlighting, filtering, and source code browsing.
;;
;; Log records are syntax highlighted using keywords such as INFO and ERROR.
;; Customizable regular expressions are used to find the beginning and end of
;; multi-line log records.
;;
;; To filter a log file buffer, type `C-c C-s', and enter the desired filter
;; criteria - any number of keywords separated by spaces. Log records that
;; contain any of the words in the include list, and none of the words in the
;; exclude list, will be copied to the filter buffer. All other log records
;; will be discarded. If the include list is blank, all log records will be
;; included. If the exclude list is blank, no records will be excluded. If the
;; log file buffer is auto reverted, the filter buffer will be updated too. To
;; stop filtering the log file buffer, just type `C-c C-s' again.
;;
;; To show the source code for a Java identifier found in the log file, place
;; the point in the identifier, and type `C-c C-b'. Log4j mode will parse the
;; expression around point, and look up the Java identifier found using jtags
;; - an Emacs package for editing and browsing Java source code.
;;
;; This command is only enabled if package jtags is loaded. Note that this
;; version of Log4j mode requires jtags version 0.95 or later. For more
;; information about jtags, see http://jtags.sourceforge.net.
;;
;; Finally, the commands `M-}' and `M-{' are redefined to move to the end
;; and beginning of the current log record.
;;
;; The latest version of Log4j mode can always be found at
;; http://log4j-mode.sourceforge.net.

;; Installation:

;; Place "log4j-mode.el" in your `load-path' and place the following lines
;; of code in your init file:
;;
;; (autoload 'log4j-mode "log4j-mode" "Major mode for viewing log files." t)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.log\\'" . log4j-mode))
;;
;; To enable source code browsing, place "jtags.el" in your `load-path' too.

;; Configuration:

;; You can customize the faces that are used for syntax highlighting.
;; Type `M-x customize-group' and enter group name "log4j-mode".
;;
;; Log file buffers are auto reverted by default. If you don't like that,
;; set `log4j-auto-revert-flag' to nil.
;;
;; You can also customize the regular expressions that are used to find the
;; beginning and end of multi-line log records. However, in many cases this
;; will not be necessary. Log4j mode can automatically detect single-line and
;; multi-line log records created by Log4j and JDK's built-in logging package.
;;
;; If you use the arrow keys to move around in the text, you can define `C-up'
;; and `C-down' to move to the end and beginning of the current log record.
;; Put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (add-hook
;;  'log4j-mode-hook
;;  (lambda ()
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control down)] 'log4j-forward-record)
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control up)] 'log4j-backward-record)))

;; XEmacs:

;; XEmacs tends to move the point to `point-min' when auto reverting a buffer.
;; Setting the customizable variable `log4j-restore-point-flag' to 't leaves
;; the point at its original position.
;;
;; To tell XEmacs which tags table files to use for log files, modify variable
;; `tag-table-alist' to include log files. Using the example in file "jtags.el"
;; you could put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (setq tag-table-alist '(("\\.\\(java\\|log\\)$" . "c:/java/j2sdk1.4.2/src")
;;                         ("\\.\\(java\\|log\\)$" . "c:/projects/tetris/src")))
